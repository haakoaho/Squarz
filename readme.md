Google Play Game Service
Our application uses Google Play Game Services as the backend for communication.
To be able to launch multiplayer mode, you need our debug.keystore file to be authenticated as
the app owner for Google.  The file should be included with the source code for the delivery, but
if it's not, then send an email to haakoaho@stud.ntnu.no to get it, then (re)place it in the .android
folder.

on Windows it's:
c://users/<username>/.android/debug.keystore
